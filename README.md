# Citi Bike Share Analysis

This notebook analyzes data from the Citi Bike Share program in New York City. The goal of the analysis is to identify outliers in the data and to remove them. After the outliers were removed, further analysis was done to look for patterns in trips, age, and gender of Citi Bike Share Users.

## Data
The data used in this analysis was obtained from the Citi Bike Share website. The data includes information about the number of rides taken, the start and end stations, and the time of day for each ride. Data linked here

## Methods

The following methods were used to analyze the data:

* importing the data into Python (pandas DataFrame)
* Data preparation
* Identifying outliers
* Statistical analysis
* Removing outliers
* Data visualization

## Findings
The analysis found that there was a spike in ‘unknown’ gender entries for birth year 1969. The outliers were removed, and the remaining data was analyzed and visualized. The top stations by number of trips were identified, and the average age and gender of the users were calculated. An interactive map with trip stats was added to visualize high-traffic stations.

## Conclusions
The removal of outliers improved the distribution of rides in the data. The visualizations showed that the distribution of rides was more symmetrical after the outliers were removed.

## Recommendations

* Use a different method to identify outliers
* Use a different method to remove outliers
* Create a map that visualizes the most common trips
